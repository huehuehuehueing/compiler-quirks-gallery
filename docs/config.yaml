scenarios:
  O0:
    flags: "-O0"
    title: "O0 - No Optimization"
    description: |
      No optimization. Code is compiled as-written with no transformations.
      Useful as a baseline to see what optimizations actually do.
      Debugging is easiest at this level.

  O2:
    flags: "-O2"
    title: "O2 - Standard Optimization"
    description: |
      Standard optimization level providing a good balance between
      compilation time and runtime performance. Enables most optimizations
      that don't involve a space-speed tradeoff. This is the recommended
      level for production builds.

  O3:
    flags: "-O3"
    title: "O3 - Aggressive Optimization"
    description: |
      Aggressive optimization level that enables all O2 optimizations plus
      additional transforms like loop unrolling, function inlining, and
      vectorization that may increase code size.

  Os:
    flags: "-Os"
    title: "Os - Size Optimization"
    description: |
      Optimize for code size rather than speed. Enables most O2 optimizations
      but avoids those that increase code size. Useful for embedded systems
      or when instruction cache pressure is a concern.

  Ofast:
    flags: "-Ofast"
    title: "Ofast - Fast Math Optimization"
    description: |
      Maximum speed optimization. Enables O3 plus -ffast-math which allows
      floating-point optimizations that may violate IEEE standards.
      Can change numerical results and break NaN/infinity handling.
      Use with caution in numerical code.
